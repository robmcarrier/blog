Which is better? Since I am a graduate of Flatiron School there is a special place in my heart for Ruby and Ruby on Rails but recently I have joined a small start-up and their stack is Python with Django.  After going through the Django docs and trying to figure out how to get things working in Python I can say that they are pretty much the same thing.  The syntax of  Python reminds me of Javascript(colons) but thats the only difference I notice between the two.  I know there are technical differences between the languages but for the most part they are able to do the same thing.  Personally, Ruby looks the most readable to me but Python isn't hard to understand either.

So why pick Ruby over Python or vise versa?  Why not just pick one language and stick with it?  If a company that you want to work for uses the language you use then that makes it easier for you but its likely that they use a different language.  Lets say you are trying to get a job at Google but you only know Ruby.  Google uses Java, Python and C++.  After research you will find that Ruby is closer in terms of syntax to Python then the other languages so you would learn Python.  Learning a new language isn't the hardest thing in the world and can only help you down the road.
