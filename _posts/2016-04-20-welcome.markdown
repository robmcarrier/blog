Hi everybody, this is my first post on this blog and it is also my first post to any blog.  I am currently going through the Full stacks program at Learn.co and I just finished making my first Ruby gem.  The gem lists the top 10 links in r/news and allows you to see the top comment for the link.  [Reddit News CLI gem][https://github.com/robmcarrier/reddit-news-cli/]
