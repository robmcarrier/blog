It can be very intimidating when you start.  If you go onto Google there are hundreds of millions of results for "Learn to code".  For anyone that wants to start coding I recommend that you start with HTML.

ex.
{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

This is an example of HTML.  Each piece of text between the "<>" is called a tag.  Most elements in HTML use an opening and closing tag.  

ex.
{% highlight html %}
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

All websites on the internet use HTML.  You can see the HTML for any website by right clicking on the webpage and selecting "Inspect Element".  You will probably see lots of divs(division or section) and things within the HTML tags themselves.  

There are many great resources to learn HTML.  I like Codecademy but there are many different options.  Next Post I will write about CSS.
