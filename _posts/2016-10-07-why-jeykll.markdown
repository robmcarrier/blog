What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a Ruby framework that lets you easily create static websites and blogs.  Just install the jekyll gem and follow a few easy steps and you will have your own blog running.

Why Jekyll?

I like Blogger but I want to host my own blog.  I could make my own blogging platform with Ruby on Rails but there is no need to do all of the work if someone else already did it.  One great thing about Jekyll is that Github allows you to host your blog on their website; there isn't a backend( you don't need a database).   You can add, delete, and edit posts through git commits.  There are also themes you can download through gems.
